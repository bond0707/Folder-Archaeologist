## Overview

**Folder Archaeologist** is an advanced command-line utility built for digital explorers, developers, and data professionals who want to analyze, categorize, and manage large folders and file collections. Harnessing the power of Python and the `rich` library, Folder Archaeologist turns directory scanning and file forensics into an accessible, visual, and highly interactive process.

## Features

- **Categorize by Extension:** Instantly group files by type to discover common or rare digital “materials.”
- **Search by Size:** Find and display files exceeding custom size thresholds, complete with live scanning progress.
- **Filter by Age:** Locate “ancient” files using flexible date/age queries.
- **Detect Naming Patterns:** Uncover file name patterns and clusters, revealing related artifacts or dataset outliers.
- **Interactive CLI:** Visually navigate results through rich menus, colored tables, and text-based dashboards.
- **Progress Bars Everywhere:** User feedback for every scan, so you’re never left guessing about progress.
- **Cross-Platform:** Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows out of the box.
- **Safe, Efficient, and Modern:** No destructive defaults, modular design, and beautiful output for real work.
